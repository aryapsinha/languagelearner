## What it does

Found in Translation (a play on the saying lost in translation) is a streamlined language learning tool that allows users to reinforce vocabulary from everyday web browsing through conversational practice. The Chrome extension detects the language of highlihgted text and translates it to English. Users are then able to save terms they wish to practice using in conversation. Saved terms and an interactable AI chatbot are available in a web app.

## Inspiration

We identified three main issues that inspired us to create this language learning tool. First, many language learners want to learn vocabulary terms that are personalized and applicable in the context of everyday life. Secondly, apps like Quizlet require users to manually compile flashcards, which can be a redundant and time-consuming process. Moreover, traditional language learning apps often lack interactive and contextual conversation practice, making it difficult for learners to apply new vocabulary in real-world scenarios. By integrating an AI chatbot that dynamically engages users with their saved words, Found in Translation bridges the gap between passive learning and active usage, fostering deeper language retention.

## How we built it

Figma -- interactive UI mockup
- Decided on themes
- Decided on effective flow
- Formatted interface of each page
- See design here: [https://www.figma.com/files/team/1470133136368142001/project/336378762/Team-project?fuid=1289369928410265773]

Programmed using React to do web development. - Code can be seen in this Github Repo
- Broke our program into smaller, reusable components.
- Built a clean UI with a table of vocabulary terms and interactive chatbot.

Connected to OpenAI API to integrate a conversational assistant into Found in Translation web app.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the main challenges we encountered was integrating multiple components, which included the Chrome extension, stored data, web app, and chatbot, into one cohesive product. To combat this, we practiced iterative programming, merged frequently. This taught us how to divide and conquer and lean on the support of our teammates 

Overall, we communicated with each other, learned on the fly, and thought outside of the box to overcome these challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to use OpenAI's API to personalize a chatbot to converse with users.

We made a Chrome extension that allows users to personalize their learning with real-life vocabulary terms.

We streamlined the process of having the chatbot incorporate terms into the conversation by adding a feature where the user can star certain terms they want to practice.


## What we learned
We learned how to create a web application using Node.js and React, and enhance our web development (HTML/CSS) skills with tools such as Bootstrap. In this process, we learned how to use OpenAI's API to implement a language learning specific chatbot to converse with users while integrating select vocabulary words into the conversation.

Moreover, we learned how to manage packages and environments with GitHub.

## What's next for Found 
- Audio/voice chatbot
- Vocabulary defintions
- Starred terms
